# Vending Machine

## Description

Implementation of vending machine program with abstracted components (Display, Feeder, Controller). 
The machine supports 10 different drinks and options for adding extras (milk, sugar, soy sauce - depending on the type of drink). 
A coin payment system is used, along with the option of giving change. Currently, communication with the machine is via a console, 
but a graphical interface design is planned for the future. A maintenance mode has also been implemented, which allows an authorised 
user to obtain information about transactions, take money out of the machine or shut it down. 

## Future additions

There are few features in development:
- more user-friendly interface
- testing
- parallel funcionality (ex. time limitation for money insertion) utilising multithreading
- more advanced maintenance options
